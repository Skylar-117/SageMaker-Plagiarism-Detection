# SageMaker-Plagiarism-Detection

## Project Overview:
In this project, I built a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeled that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is to a provided source text.

The project is broken into 3 parts: 
- Part 1: data exploration
- Part 2: feature engineering
- Part 3: train and deploy model in SageMaker
